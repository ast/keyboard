# Update 2017-10-14

I can't believe it's already been four years since I published this!

This repo has generated considerable interest and I regularly receive
email about it. **However, I do not longer actively work on this
project**. I'm not able to help you with your keyboard project.


I have stopped using the Teensy for my keyboard and switched to
the [ucapps](http://www.ucapps.de/) project. Might publish something
about that in the future.

## Other keyboard project that I know about

These might be helpful.

# Arduino clone midi keyboard

A Teensy (Arduino clone) powered velocity sensitive USB MIDI keyboard
with sustain pedal. Works with diode matrix keybeds. I used one from
Fatar (also known as Studiologic).

Using the teensy USB MIDI library it works as a class compliant USB
MIDI device.

I have only included the source and a very basic schematic here. Feel
free to contact me if you have any questions.

## Circuit

As you can see on
the
[keyboard matrix schematic](http://www.doepfer.de/DIY/Matrix_88.gif),
the 88 keys are arranged in to two diode matrices. There are actually
176 switches in the matrix. The reason for this is that there are two
switches under each key. When a key is pressed, one of the switches
closes slightly before the other one. By measuring the time of flight
between the switches we can derive the velocity.

I've included a rudimentary schematic how I use 3 74ls138
demultiplexers to address the rows. With this arrangement I use 8 + 5
pins to scan the keybed.


## TODO / Bugs


This is a bit of a hack but it works quite well for now.

If you have any insights to these questions please let me know!

* Is a scanning frequency of 1000Hz too low? I've heard somewhere
  commercial keyboard use 2000Hz. Perhaps someone can measure one with
  a scope?
* Right now the velocity response is linear and quite low
  resolution. What is a good velocity response curve?
* Is it a bad idea to join the two matrices? Perhaps it's a better
  idea to use a separate micro controller for each matrix and let them
  talk together using i2c? This approach would be more modular and
  allow for stacking a lot of keys (in an organ i.e..)
* I'm using the Teensy USB MIDI library. I'm not sure how this
  interferes with the timing of the scanning interrupt routine.
